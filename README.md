### TDD trial using C++

#### License
- MIT License
   - **See LICENSE file**

#### Depends on:
- **Boost**
- **C++11 compiler** *(makefile sets -std=c++14, but it's easily changed)*
  - I used g++ 4.9.1

Don't be too harsh, I know I kinda didn't follow TDD directives fully, but this is just some practice programming.

#### Vector
- A great deal has already been done!
- ***Class only compiles for if T == float, double or long double***
- Couldn't figure out yet how to limit class to floating point without creating dummy pointer _class_enable...

#### Matrix
- Basic usage done
